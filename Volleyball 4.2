MODE FUNCTIONALITIES:
Setting - The setting mode auto aims towards the antennas on both sides when you set the ball using your forward and backwards set key.
Serving - The serving mode aims randomly at the two far corners of your opponents court, allowing you to always hit the corners with precise accuracy.
Spiking - The spiking mode has two modes, the random mode aims randomly anywhere on the opponents court while the point mode aims where your mouse is pointed.
Power - The power mode automatically sets your power to the maximum amount when you jump.
Sprint - The sprint mode automatically hits your sprint key when you move.
